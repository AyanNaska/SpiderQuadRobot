# SpiderQuadRobot

This project contains the code and instructions for building a spider quadrupedal robot 

## **Materials**
To build the robot, you will need the following materials:

3D printed parts of the robot
ESPDuino-32 ESP32 WEMOS D1 R32 microcontroller
PCA9865 16-channel servo motor driver (works with I2C)
SG90 servo motors (16)
Jumper wires

## **Code**
The code for the robot is written in the Arduino IDE and can be found in the ArechoCrawl.ino file. 

## **Usage**
To use the robot, simply upload the code to the ESP32 microcontroller and power on the robot. The robot can be controlled through the Arduino IDE serial monitor, allowing you to command it to walk, turn, crouch, and perform other movements.

## **Contributing**
If you would like to contribute to the project, please submit a pull request. Any contributions are welcome, including bug fixes, code optimizations, and new features.
